# JScounterproject
1st JS project. interactive buttons that log a count and reset to zero. previous counts are saved
Since i love BJJ, i decided to slightly customize this project for the purpose of keeping track of guard passes per round. one siplz clicks the passes button however many times they passed. Followed by the save button so that then we can continue with the process for the following rounds.
In this project i have utalised HTML CSS JavaScript.
